This repository contains the code to train and evaluate BEDLAM-CLIFF, BEDLAM-HMR, BEDLAM-CLIFF-X model from the paper. If you are interested in the Unreal code for rendering synthetic images, please check out the repository [here](https://github.com/PerceivingSystems/bedlam_render). To process the data generated by Unreal into a format that could be used for training please checkout [data_processing](data_processing/ReadMe.md) section.

## News
*2023/07/04: Converted SMPL ground truth labels for training available on [project page](https://bedlam.is.tue.mpg.de).*  

## Install
Create a virtual environment and install all the requirements
```
python3.8 -m venv bedlam_venv
source bedlam_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Demo



### Prepare data
If you need to run just the demo, please follow the following steps:

Step 1. Register on [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/) website.

Step 2. Register on [MANO](https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/) website.

Step 3. Register on [BEDLAM](https://bedlam.is.tue.mpg.de/) website.

Step 4. Run the following script to fetch demo data. The script will need the username and password created in above steps.
```
bash fetch_demo_data.sh
```

### BEDLAM-CLIFF demo

```
 python demo.py --cfg configs/demo_bedlam_cliff.yaml

```
### BEDLAM-CLIFF-X demo
```
python demox.py --cfg configs/demo_bedlam_cliff_x.yaml --display
```

## Dataset visualization
Once you download BEDLAM dataset following the instructions in [training.md](docs/training.md), you can use the script to visualize the projection of 3D bodies on images
```
python visualize_ground_truth.py output_dir
```

## Evaluation
For instructions on how to run evaluation on different benchmarks please refer to [evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md)


## Training
For instructions on how to run training please refer to [training.md](docs/training.md)

## BEDLAM leaderboard
If you want to upload your results to BEDLAM evaluation server, please follow the instructions [here](docs/leaderboard.md).
